THIS IS NOT USABLE, THEY SPENT THE WHOLE TIME IN THE TEST CORNER BECAUSE OF THE AGAROSE...
LESSON LEARNED, ALWAYS REPOUR

In this experiment the control corner agarose was damaged, giving a rougher, less even surface.
Rough surfaces are generally more appetitive for flies, particularly females when laying eggs.
These experiments are with males, so it might matter less, but it's still a confound. Will run 
anyway and see if there is some effect. What it might do is cancel out any inherent aversive signal
from the geosmin, so this will obviously need repeating. In the analysis we could make N the number
of flies rather than the number of trials, but the data are not independent in that case.
