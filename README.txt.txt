Notes on the file organisation:

Mateja saved files from each day in here. Because of this it is a bit of a mess. 
This wouldn't be a problem if the MATLAB data object that is the output of MARGO didn't contain directory information. 
Because of this, you cannot change the path of the data without corrupting the whole thing. 
The data object output by MARGO is explained in a bit more detail below, summarised from: https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo/wiki/Data-Outputs#the-experimentdata-object-expmt
We can copy all the files into a new folder structure, and they can be opened as long as the original files remain in their
original filepath...I don't entirely understand how this happens, but it does. 

So from now on data will be saved the way I like, and all the old stuff will have to stay where it was until I can figure out
how to change it. It will be messy, but there you go. 

For now I think the better folder structure is to organise by condition/genotype etc. (entrained/geosmin_air OR geosmin_agarose/mated_females OR virgins/date/file

So new data will be saved like this, and the old data will be copied and reorganised, leaving the old stuff in place.
